Write a program that will take as a argument a string containing only patenthesis.
If the paranthesis are unbalanced (for example "())") you rprogram shall remove the minimum number or parenthesis for the expression to be balanced.
By removing we mean replacing by spaces.
You will then print all the solutions (can be more then one).

The order of the solution is not important.

For example this should work:
./rip "(()" | cat -e
 ()$
( )$

./rip "()"
()

./rip "()())()"
()() ()
()( )()
( ())()
